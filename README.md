  TikTok

My team and I came up with the idea of ​​creating a TikTok app. We first wrote an introduction that explains a lot about Tik Tok. After that, we identified the functional and non-functional requirements and used the four drawings:
1-Activity diagram
2-use case 
3-squence diagram
4-class diagram
At the end of the project, we wrote its conclusion about the TikTok application
